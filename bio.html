      <h2 class="logoText">Bio</h2>
      <p class="lead">Pipko Fanfare is a transgender woman in her mid 30s who makes music about trans issues and life in the closet.</p>
      <img class="float-md-end mw-100" src="transparentsmall.png">
      <p>Her debut album <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/album/finding-my-voice">Finding My Voice</a> is an experimental/alternative rock concept album that takes the listener on a journey through musical styles from punk to grunge to blues to chiptune. Everything was recorded, mixed, and mastered in her home studio.</p>
      <p>Both it and her follow-up single <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/track/double-agent">Double Agent</a> were written while she was still closeted in real life, and feature highly digitally effected and artificially feminized vocals over raw rock guitars.</p>
      <p>Now she is out to the world and working on her transition &ndash; as well as a new album currently planned to be about the coming out process and how transition affects her. As part of her transition, she is taking vocal lessons and hopes to be able to release music with her natural voice in the future.</p>

      <p>Pipko has used multiple guitars over the years. <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/album/finding-my-voice">Finding My Voice</a> was recorded with a (dirt) cheap strat-style guitar simply called "The Sonora" after its manufacturer. It is the black guitar with white pickguard shown in the art above. Unfortunately, this guitar wasn't able to make the trip from Albany to Portland and was given away.</p>
      <p>Pipko's current guitar "Izzy" is The Sonora's replacement and can be heard on <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/track/double-agent">Double Agent</a>. It's an Ibanez GRG131DX with black body and red pickguard.</p>
      <p>Her bass guitar "Arceme" is a jewel blue Ibanez GSR200 that she has owned for many years and used in previous musical projects. It makes an appearance on nearly every song &ndash; with notable exceptions being <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/track/impostor">Impostor</a> and <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/track/trapped">Trapped</a> (both of which feature guest artist Romart on bass guitar) and <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/track/digital-girl">Digital Girl</a> (which uses a synth bass instead). It is usually used in conjunction with a SansAmp Programmable Bass Driver DI.</p>
      <p>Pipko generally prefers the flexibility of working with virtual effects and amps rather than real ones. The early songs in <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/album/finding-my-voice">Finding My Voice</a> used a wide variety of (mostly free) amp, cabinet, and pedal simulatons. Later tracks in the album and <a href="https://pipko.bandcamp.com/track/double-agent">Double Agent</a> predominantly use BIAS Amp 2 and BIAS FX 2 for guitar tone. Virtual drums on the early songs are generally either MTPower Drumkit2 or SM Drums. Later tracks utilize EZDrummer 2, especially the Alt-Rock pack. Pipko's primary DAW is Reaper, though she also occasionally uses FL Studio as well as a secondary DAW.</p>
